\section{XBX Devices under Test (XBD)}
\subsection{TI Stellaris\textregistered~LM4F120 LaunchPad}

Neither the Debug, nor the Device USB should be connected for power measurements.
The \emph{+3.3V} line on pin J1.1 of the boosterpack connector is connected 
directly to the In-Circuit Debugger. Therefore, it is recommended to select on the
XBP to power the XBD via the external XBD connector and not via the boosterpack
connector. On the TI Stellaris Launchpad, the VDD jumper has to be pulled and the
external 3.3V has to be supplied to the right pin. The green power LED on the
Launchpad lights up when the 3.3V are supplied to the left (wrong) pin. 
The \emph{PWR Select} switch can be in any position and won't affect the 
measurements.

\subsection{TI Tiva\texttrademark~C Series TM4C123G LaunchPad}

The circuit connections are the same as on the TI Stellaris LaunchPad. Please follow
those instructions. Supply voltage is 3.3V with a maximum current of 300\,mA.

\subsection{TI MSP430F5529 LaunchPad\texttrademark}

For precise current measurements remove all jumpers from the isolation jumper block 
with the exception of the ground (GND) jumper. 

\subsection{TI MSP430FR6989 LaunchPad\texttrademark}

For precise current measurements remove all jumpers from the isolation jumper block 
with the exception of the ground (GND) jumper. Supply voltage is 3.3V with a maximum 
current of 2.7\,mA not including LEDs or external circuitry.
