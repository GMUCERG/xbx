We describe our experimental post-quantum cryptography implementations on small devices with different platforms. Then, we present and compare the performance results of chosen post-quantum key exchange schemes and their message sizes on selected ARM devices. In addition, we discuss the perspective types of post-quantum cryptographic schemes for various IoT systems with different requirements."
